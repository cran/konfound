Description: Statistical methods that quantify the conditions necessary to alter
    inferences, also known as sensitivity analysis, are becoming increasingly
    important to a variety of quantitative sciences. A series of recent works,
    including Frank (2000) <doi:10.1177/0049124100029002001> and Frank et al.
    (2013) <doi:10.3102/0162373713493129> extend previous sensitivity analyses
    by considering the characteristics of omitted variables or unobserved cases
    that would change an inference if such variables or cases were observed. These
    analyses generate statements such as "an omitted variable would have to be
    correlated at xx with the predictor of interest (e.g., treatment) and outcome
    to invalidate an inference of a treatment effect". Or "one would have to replace
    pp percent of the observed data with null hypothesis cases to invalidate the
    inference". We implement these recent developments of sensitivity analysis and
    provide modules to calculate these two robustness indices and generate such
    statements in R. In particular, the functions konfound(), pkonfound() and 
    mkonfound() allow users to calculate the robustness of inferences for a user's 
    own model, a single published study and multiple studies respectively.
